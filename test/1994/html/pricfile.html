      <h2><em>The Wine Price File</em></h2>
    </font>
  </center>Our electronic version of <b>The Wine Price File</b> is now available. It is derived from the database that
  is used to produce the 500-page Wine Price File book.

  <p>We identified those wines in the book <i><b>also</b></i> reviewed in <b>The Wine Advocate</b>
    during the years 1992-95. We imported pricing for all vintages of
    these wines. For example, 25 vintages of Mouton-Rothschild were
    reviewed in <b>The Wine Advocate</b> from 1992-95 but we provide pricing for all 121 vintages contained in<b>The
      Wine Price File</b>.
    Separate pricing is provided for each bottle size. Thus, for Mouton
    (as shown below) a total of 264 vintage/bottle size records are
    available. Each record contains eight separate items of pricing
    information along with a count of the number of prices from which they
    were derived.<br></p>

  In total over 60,000 individual prices are included for some 6,000
  wines. Prices in the database are from 300 retail and auction catalogs.
  We distinguish between retail (purple triangles) and auction (blue
  dots) pricing, as shown in the sample price graph for the 1990 Chateau
  Margaux.<center><img src="/1994/img/prgrph2.gif" alt="prgrph2.gif - 5.7 K" width="366" vspace="24" height="378"></center>

  <p>You can display a graph like this for any of the 6,000 wines for
    which pricing is available. Note that both a price trend line (green
    diamonds) and your current price (yellow dot) can be displayed.

  </p>
  <p> <img src="/1994/img/cost.gif" alt="cost.gif - 9.7 K" width="320" hspace="24" height="431" align="left">You
    can use the pricing data to value your cellar by calculating a
    "projected current replacement cost" for each wine. With future
    versions of our electronic wine price guide, your cellar can be
    automatically revalued. </p>
  <p>The prices used for valuation can be
    selected by you on a wine-by-wine basis. Where a particular price is
    not available, a series of defaults will apply as shown to the left.
    In this example, if it is available, the Estimated Auction Price will be
    used to value the 1991 Mouton (if the <b><u>S</u>et This Record</b>
    button is depressed). Otherwise, the Estimated Retail Price, if
    available, will be used followed by Parker's Estimated Cost, if
    available. </p>
  <p>If you use the Visual Cellar Manager, pricing can be controlled separately for each bottle (green area of the
    window).<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
