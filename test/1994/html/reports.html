  </center>When any group of wines is displayed in a table it can be
  printed just as seen on the computer display. The software allows the
  columns within the wine table to be moved around and expanded or
  contracted. It allows columns not of interest to be "hidden". It also
  allows the number of rows per column to be adjusted. All of these
  capabilities were used to produce the table with three wines illustrated
  in the discussion on <a
    href"/1994/img//theoldnet.com/navbar?decode=true&amp;noscripts=true&amp;year=1997&amp;navbar=true&amp;url=http://winetech.com/1994/html/search.html" " target="
    _top">searching for wines</a>.<p>The software also comes with numerous predefined reports which produce
    statistical analyses of: <b>1)</b> your wine cellar <b>2)</b> the entire wine database or <b>3)</b> a selected
    subset of the database. <img src="/1994/img/maturity.gif" alt="maturity.gif - 14.5 K" width="473" vspace="6" hspace="12"

    For example, as shown, you can ask for an analysis of wines based upon
    their maturity. The computer will look at the date range specified by
    Robert Parker for drinking each wine and the current date. Based upon
    this comparison wines will be grouped in drinking maturity ranges, as
    shown. The wines can be further subdivided based upon variety (as
    shown), producer, vintage, country and a number of other factors. Note
    that only 2 of the 70 varieties found are shown in this example.</p>
  <p>Another analysis looks at wines in your cellar <i><b>or</b></i>
    in any subset you choose from the entire wine database by Parker's
    rating ranges. The ranges are according to the scale of 50-100 used in <b>The Wine Advocate</b>. </p>
  <p><img src="/1994/img/rating.gif" alt="rating.gif - 17.6 K" width="519" vspace="6" hspace="12" height="200"
      align="middle">
  </p>
  <p>Within this scale wines are grouped as:
  </p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li><b>Extraordinary </b>-- a rating of 96-100
    </li>
    <li><b>Outstanding</b> -- a rating of 90-95
    </li>
    <li><b>Good to Very Good</b> -- a rating of 80-89
    </li>
    <li><b>Average</b> -- a rating of 70-79
    </li>
    <li><b>Below Average</b> -- a rating of 60-69
    </li>
    <li><b>Avoid</b> -- a rating of 50-59
    </li>
  </ul>
  As before, the wines can be further subdivided by producer, vintage,
  country, region within a country or location within a region (as shown).
  Note that only 3 of the 374 locations found are shown in the example.<p> <img src="/1994/img/drinkmap.gif"
      alt="drinkmap.gif - 14.4 K" width="489" vspace="6" hspace="12" height="169" align="right">Yet one more analysis is
    the automated <b>Drink Plan</b>.
    Here the computer looks at the quantity of wines in your cellar based
    upon any of the subdivisions available (variety, producer, vintage,
    country and others) and shows how many bottles are available during each
    year over the next decade. Consideration is given for the date range
    during which each wine should be consumed according to Parker. The
    computer assumes that each wine will be consumed at a constant rate
    during that range. Thus, for example, if your cellar contains 10
    bottles of a chardonnay which should be drunk over the next two years
    according to Parker, the computer will add five bottles each year to the
    Drink Plan. Note that only 3 of the 20 varieties found and 6 of the 10
    years reported are shown in this example.</p>
  <p>Producing any of these
    reports (or dozens of others not shown here) is simply a matter of
    asking for it. There are no complex questionnaires to complete.
    Production typically takes a few seconds.
