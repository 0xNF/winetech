  </center>The process of creating tasting notes that are specific to each wine is described in the discussion of <a
    href"/1994/img//theoldnet.com/navbar?decode=true&amp;noscripts=true&amp;year=1997&amp;navbar=true&amp;url=http://winetech.com/1994/html/database.html" " target="
    _top"> the wine database</a>. <img src="/1994/img/form2.gif" alt="form2.gif - 14.8 K" width="343" vspace="6" hspace="12"
    height="183" align="left">As
  illustrated below, notes can be called up for any wine in the database.
  Where Parker has tasted the same wine on multiple occasions (in
  different issues of <b>The Wine Advocate</b>) these notes will be linked to the same wine in the database. Thus, each
  wine in the database has a <b>Tasting Count </b>recording
  the number of tastings on file. You may add your own tastings or
  tastings obtained from other sources. They will be filed, along with
  the tastings from <b>The Wine Advocate</b>, with the appropriate wine. You can <a

    _top">search</a> for wines based upon the words used in the tasting notes. <p> When wines are displayed in
    groups within a table (as illustrated in the discussion on <a href="/1994/html/search.html" target=" _top">searching</a>
    for
    wines of interest) one of Parker's tastings and one of the tastings you have entered will be displayed. These will
    be the <b>Active</b> tastings, normally the most recent.</p>

      align="right">When wines are displayed one at a time on the <b>Main Form</b>
    you will be shown (right) the tasting count and can toggle instantly
    from one tasting note to the next. You can see which of your and
    Parker's tastings is set as the Active tasting. You will also see
    information about the tasting, such as the issue and article in which it
    appeared, as well as some of the structured data derived from that
    tasting (rating, price, when to drink, and so forth). You can enter
    this same information for your own tastings.</p>

      align="left">Should
    you have <i><b>vintages</b></i> not included in the database <i><b>for wines that are in the database</b></i> you
    can easily make a <b>Copy </b>of any wine. This process is as simple as pushing the <b>Copy This Wine</b>
    button (left). This will automatically prompt you for the new vintage
    year entry. Thus you can supplement the database to represent any wine
    collection -- no matter how extensive -- with a minimal amount of
    typing. More importantly, you are insured that, should Parker review
    the "missing" vintage in some future issue, the software will be able to
    match the future tasting with your entry!
