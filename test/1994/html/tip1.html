        <h2><em>Stepping Among Windows Using the Keyboard</em></h2>
    </font>
    </center>
    Often you may wish to have several windows open at the same time.
    Unless you have a large monitor and operate it at high resolution (e.g.
    1024x768 pixels or above), it is normally not possible to spread the
    windows out so that they are all simultaneously visible. Clicking on
    any part of a window with the mouse makes it the "active window" and
    brings it to the top. However, It can be difficult or impossible to
    click on a window when it is mostly or entirely obscured by another. We
    have a <a href="/1994/html/tip2.html" target="_top">Mouse Trick </a>to offer in this regard.<p>

        As an alternative to the mouse, you might wish to use the <b>CTRL</b>-<b>TAB</b>
        keys. This is a "standard" Windows convention that works across all of
        the windows in The Wine Advisor - even minimized windows. Just hold
        down either the left or right <b>CTRL</b> key and tap the<b> TAB</b> key. Each time you depress the <b>TAB</b>
        key you will "step" through the opened windows, one at a time.</p>
    <p>

        We also provide a method for stepping across only the non-minimized
        windows which starts with the most recently used window and goes in the
        order of most recent use. Just hold down the <b>ALT </b>key and tap either the Gray <b>+</b> (the one that is
        part of the numeric keypad) or the "<b>;</b>"
        (the semicolon, which is easier to reach). This particular method can
        be very convenient if you have two or three windows you wish move among.
