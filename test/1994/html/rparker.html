    </center>Robert Parker was born in Baltimore and both trained and worked
    as a lawyer. He discovered wine at the age of 20 on a trip to Alsace.
    Frustrated at the lack of a truly independent and reliable source of
    wine criticism, he launched his bimonthly newsletter, <b><a href="/1994/html/wineadvo.html" target=" _top">The Wine
            Advocate</a></b>,
    in 1978. His reputation was established when he was one of the first
    wine critics to recognize the greatness of the now legendary 1982
    Bordeaux vintage.<p>Parker was the first to apply a numeric score to
        rate the quality of each wine he tastes. Nevertheless, at the beginning
        of each issue of the newsletter he reminds his readers that his
        numerical ratings are "utilized only to enhance and complement the
        thorough tasting notes, which are my primary means of communicating my
        judgements to you."</p>
    <p>In addition to <b>The Wine Advocate</b> (from which the wine database included with the software is derived -- <a
            href="/1994/html/database.html" target=" _top">click here</a> to learn more about this process), Parker is the
        author of several of the wine world's most definitive books: <i>Bordeaux</i>, <i>Burgundy</i> and <i>The Wines
            of the Rhône Valley and Provence</i>.</p>
    <p>Parker was the first non-Frenchman to write a wine column for <i>L'Express</i> magazine, and was awarded the
        Chevalier de l'Ordre du Mérite National in 1992.</p>
