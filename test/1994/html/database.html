                                    made from Gauer Ranch grapes. This wine reveals a mineral component,
                                    along with tremendous quantities of rich fruit, plenty of intensity,
                                    full body, a beautiful, well-knit personality, and a long, dry finish.

    <p>Parker frequently reviews a number of wines recently
        released by a producer together in a combined tasting note that can
        consume many paragraphs or, with 'prolific' producers such as Guigal or
        Georges Duboeuf, much of an entire printed page. Wine Technologies
        carefully edits these combined notes so that the tasting note for <i><b>each </b></i>wine is presented with that
        wine on the computer screen. </p>
    <p>The
        process of editing Parker's tastings for inclusion with the software is
        easily understood from this example. This wine was reviewed in Issue
        101 (October, 1995) of <b>The Wine Advocate</b> along with three other
        chardonnays produced by Peter Michael Winery in 1993. The entire review
        is about four times as long as the sample shown -- the remaining text
        relates to each of the other three wines and is not included in our
        tasting note for <i><b>this </b></i>wine. The appropriate parts of this remaining text would be included in the
        database entries for each of the <i><b>other</b></i> three wines. Thus, the database contains virtually the
        entire contents of <b>The Wine Advocate</b>
        -- the key difference being the editing of information so that specific
        information pertaining to each wine can be presented along with that
        wine. </p>
    <p>Our note for this wine is shown below, and combines any specific comments about the 1993 Monplaisir (<font
            color="#008000">green </font>in the example) with any general comments which apply to all the wines reviewed
        (<font color="#FF8000">orange</font> in the example) as well as with any information that applies to the
        producer (<font color="#FF0000">red</font>
        in the example). Note that the first sentence of Parker's combined
        tasting note has been reworded slightly to read properly within a note
        for a single wine. </p>

    <p>Structured information consists of those characteristics you can use to select and sort wines. In the example it
        includes:<br>
    </p>
    <ul type="disc">
        <li>The Producer Name -- <b>Peter Michael</b>
        </li>
        <li>The Vintage Year -- <b>1993</b>
        </li>
        <li>The Variety -- <b>Chardonnay</b>
        </li>
        <li>The Label Name of This Wine -- <b>Monplaisir</b>
        </li>
        <li>The Location -- <b>Sonoma</b>
        </li>
        <li>The Estimated Retail Price -- <b>$28.00</b>
        </li>
        <li>The Color -- <b>White</b>
        </li>
        <li> Parker's Rating -- <b>92</b>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <br>Other structured data can be inferred. This includes when the wine
    should be drunk (3-5 years from the date of the issue for the example),
    the dryness of this wine and the type of wine (table, dessert,
    sparkling). The range of dates over which a wine should be drunk is
    derived by us from the Parker tasting note. Occasionally Parker's note
    does not include this information or provides only general advice. We
    avoid interpretation in these cases and generally will not provide
    specific Drink From and Drink Thru values. <p>You can find wines using the software based on any combination of
        these structured criteria. Thus a question like "<strong>Which chardonnays from the 1993 vintage in California
            rated above 90 but cost less than $30.00?<em></em></strong>"
        can be answered in seconds. You can also search the tasting notes to
        find, for example, chardonnays described by Robert Parker as having a
        "mineral component". Either query would find the particular chardonnay
        used in this illustration.
