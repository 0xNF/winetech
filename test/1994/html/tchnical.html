      <h2><em>Technical Features of the Software</em></h2>
    </font>
  </center><b> The Visual Cellar Display:</b> This is clearly the most
  striking feature of the software. Very quick screen display of
  thousands of bottles (up to about 3,000) at one time is technically very
  difficult. Normal programming techniques - providing the flexibility
  of our software - would be visibly slow even showing as few as 200
  bottles.<p> A key flexibility feature is the resizability of the Visual
    Cellar windows. To a degree not often appreciated, the physical
    limitations of a computer monitor impose enormous restrictions on
    computer software. The ability to expand or contract the cellar windows
    greatly increases the usability of the system.</p>
  <p> Another key
    feature is the integration of the underlying SQL database with the
    Visual Cellar. The automatic coloring of bottles to present the results
    of a database query is a particularly exciting feature of the software.
    To our knowledge, no other computer application utilizes visual
    presentation of database information to the degree achieved in this
    feature. </p>
  <p> A third key feature is the integration of the table
    presentation of wines with the Visual Cellar. The "focus" in the Visual
    Cellar automatically tracks with the "focus" within any of the rows in
    the table creating a clear visual link between these two alternate
    displays of information.</p>
  <p><b>Mixed Database of Shipped and User Information:</b>
    Many products present predefined databases of computerized
    information. A few even focus on wine related information. Many other
    products are designed for user created databases. Contact Managers are a
    common example. Very few products deal with a mixture of the two
    scenarios. Creating a smooth integration of the two is technically
    demanding. The degree to which this has been achieved is best
    illustrated by the capability of the software to automatically link
    wines <i><b>added by the user</b></i> with <i><b>future </b></i>reviews of the same wine written by Robert Parker!
  </p>
  <p><b>Intelligent Lookup: </b>
    The Internet has created a wide understanding of the concept of
    text-based information location. Popular Internet facilities like Yahoo
    and Alta Vista quickly become necessities to frequent browsers of the
    Web. Anyone experienced in their use knows that careful wording of the
    search text is essential. It is also typically unforgiving and can
    therefore be frustrating. This software attempts to create a more
    forgiving environment. It automatically creates word-by-word indexes
    for seven key wine characteristics (producer, label name, country,
    region, location, vintage, and variety). The magic comes in being able
    to input "snippets" of text to indicate the desired wines. You need not
    know the correct spelling of <b>Tetre-Roteboeuf</b> to find it
    virtually instantly. Nor do you have to identify 1990 as a vintage.
    The result is the ability to precisely find wines through a text string
    that comes naturally.</p>
  <p> You can even bring up a list of all the
    key word entries beginning with any letter combination, optionally even
    with a display of frequency. The same capability exists for the words
    used in the tasting notes (Just how often <i><b>does </b></i>Parker use the word <b>bold</b>?). </p>
  <p>For
    the even more adventurous, we provide a facility that will compile all
    the unique entries for any wine characteristic, again with optional
    display of frequency. This list itself can be quite educational. Once
    the list is up, just click on any entry to see a list of all matching
    wines! The list stays up for re-clicking. A very powerful way to
    explore the world of wines.</p>
  <p><b>A Few More "Quickies":</b>

  </p>
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>Drag and drop bottles from one location in a cellar to another
      location in that cellar or in another cellar window. All bottles with
      the same characteristic can be moved at the same time.
    </li>
    <li>Bin order and bin labeling can be done virtually anyway you
      want. Neither need be just "left to right" or "top to bottom". Common
      label sequences are generated automatically.
    </li>
    <li>Dynamic display of the bin label under the cursor.
    </li>
    <li>Easy experimentation with new bottle arrangements. Move all
      bottles with a common characteristic in bulk to see, for example, if
      your Italian wines will all fit in a particular cellar area. Like a
      spreadsheet, if you don't save a rearrangement, the current data is
      unchanged. Most databases don't provide this type of flexible analysis.
    </li>
  </ul>
