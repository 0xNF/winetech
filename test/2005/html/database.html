                    <p>Parker frequently reviews a number of wines recently
                        released by a producer together in a combined tasting note that can
                        consume many paragraphs or, with 'prolific' producers such as Guigal or
                        Georges Duboeuf, much of an entire printed page. Wine Technologies
                        carefully edits these combined notes so that the tasting note for <i><b>each </b></i>wine is
                        presented with that wine on the computer screen. </p>
                    <p>The
                        process of editing Parker's tastings for inclusion with the software is
                        easily understood from this example. This wine was reviewed in Issue
                        101 (October, 1995) of <b>The Wine Advocate</b> along with three other
                        chardonnays produced by Peter Michael Winery in 1993. The entire review
                        is about four times as long as the sample shown -- the remaining text
                        relates to each of the other three wines and is not included in our
                        tasting note for <i><b>this </b></i>wine. The appropriate parts of this remaining text would be
                        included in the database entries for each of the <i><b>other</b></i> three wines. Thus, the
                        database contains virtually the entire contents of <b>The Wine Advocate</b>
                        -- the key difference being the editing of information so that specific
                        information pertaining to each wine can be presented along with that
                        wine. </p>
                    <p>Our note for this wine is shown below, and combines any specific comments about the 1993
                        Monplaisir (<font color="#008000">green </font>in the example) with any general comments which
                        apply to all the wines reviewed (<font color="#FF8000">orange</font> in the example) as well as
                        with any information that applies to the producer (<font color="#FF0000">red</font>
                        in the example). Note that the first sentence of Parker's combined
                        tasting note has been reworded slightly to read properly within a note
                        for a single wine. </p>

                    <p>Structured information consists of those characteristics you can use to select and sort wines. In
                        the example it includes:<br>
                    </p>
                    <ul type="disc">

                        <li>The Vintage Year -- <b>1993</b>
                        </li>
                        <li>The Variety -- <b>Chardonnay</b>
                        </li>
                        <li>The Label Name of This Wine -- <b>Monplaisir</b>
                        </li>
                        <li>The Location -- <b>Sonoma</b>
                        </li>
                        <li>The Estimated Retail Price -- <b>$28.00</b>
                        </li>
                        <li>The Color -- <b>White</b>
                        </li>
                        <li> Parker's Rating -- <b>92</b>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>Other structured data can be inferred. This includes when the wine
                    should be drunk (3-5 years from the date of the issue for the example),
                    the dryness of this wine and the type of wine (table, dessert,
                    sparkling). The range of dates over which a wine should be drunk is
                    derived by us from the Parker tasting note. Occasionally Parker's note
                    does not include this information or provides only general advice. We
                    avoid interpretation in these cases and generally will not provide
                    specific Drink From and Drink Thru values. <p>You can find wines using the software based on any
                        combination of these structured criteria. Thus a question like "<strong>Which chardonnays from
                            the 1993 vintage in California rated above 90 but cost less than $30.00?<em></em></strong>"
                        can be answered in seconds. You can also search the tasting notes to
                        find, for example, chardonnays described by Robert Parker as having a
                        "mineral component". Either query would find the particular chardonnay
                        used in this illustration.
