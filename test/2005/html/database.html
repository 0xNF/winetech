<br></center><p>Parker frequently reviews a number of wines recently 
released by a producer together in a combined tasting note that can 
consume many paragraphs or, with 'prolific' producers such as Guigal or 
Georges Duboeuf, much of an entire printed page.  Wine Technologies 
carefully edits these combined notes so that the tasting note for <i><b>each </b></i>wine is presented with that wine on the computer screen. </p><p>The
 process of editing Parker's tastings for inclusion with the software is
 easily understood from this example.  This wine was reviewed in Issue 
101 (October, 1995) of <b>The Wine Advocate</b> along with three other 
chardonnays produced by Peter Michael Winery in 1993.  The entire review
 is about four times as long as the sample shown -- the remaining text 
relates to each of the other three wines and is not included in our 
tasting note for <i><b>this </b></i>wine.  The appropriate parts of this remaining text would be included in the database entries for each of the <i><b>other</b></i> three wines.  Thus, the database contains virtually the entire contents of <b>The Wine Advocate</b>
 -- the key difference being the editing of information so that specific
 information pertaining to each wine can be presented along with that 
wine.  </p><p>Our note for this wine is shown below, and combines any specific comments about the 1993 Monplaisir (<font color="#008000">green </font>in the example) with any general comments which apply to all the wines reviewed (<font color="#FF8000">orange</font> in the example) as well as with any information that applies to the producer (<font color="#FF0000">red</font>
 in the example).  Note that the first sentence of Parker's combined 
tasting note has been reworded slightly to read properly within a note 
for a single wine. </p><center><a name="note"></a><p><img src="/2005/img/pmnote.gif" alt="pmnote.gif - 6.37 K" width="451" height="229" align="middle"></p></center><p>Structured information consists of those characteristics you can use to select and sort wines. In the example it includes:<br>
</p><ul type="disc">
<li>The Producer Name -- <b>Peter Michael</b>
</li><li>The Vintage Year -- <b>1993</b>
</li><li>The Variety -- <b>Chardonnay</b>
</li><li>The Label Name of This Wine -- <b>Monplaisir</b>
</li><li>The Location -- <b>Sonoma</b>
</li><li>The Estimated Retail Price -- <b>$28.00</b>
</li><li>The Color -- <b>White</b>
</li><li> Parker's Rating -- <b>92</b>
</li></ul>
<br>Other structured data can be inferred.  This includes when the wine 
should be drunk (3-5 years from the date of the issue for the example), 
the dryness of this wine and the type of wine (table, dessert, 
sparkling).  The range of dates over which a wine should be drunk is 
derived by us from the Parker tasting note.  Occasionally Parker's note 
does not include this information or provides only general advice.  We 
avoid interpretation in these cases and generally will not provide 
specific Drink From and Drink Thru values.  <p>You can find wines using the software based on any combination of these structured criteria.  Thus a question like "<strong>Which chardonnays from the 1993 vintage in California rated above 90 but cost less than $30.00?<em></em></strong>"
 can be answered in seconds.  You can also search the tasting notes to 
find, for example, chardonnays described by Robert Parker as having a 
"mineral component".  Either query would find the particular chardonnay 
used in this illustration.
