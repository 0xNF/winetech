This small sample illustrates many of the powerful capabilities 
available to you using the grid.  You can select the wines to be 
included (in this case Bordeaux wines with a perfect Parker rating of 
100).  You can arrange the order of the columns by moving them around 
with the mouse.  You can "hide" columns you don't wish to see (here the 
country, region, wine color and others are hidden).  You can also sort 
the table based upon any of the columns (here the table was sorted by 
vintage year).</p><p>You can save as many of these grids as you wish.  Each becomes a named "View" which you can recall at any time.</p><p>
 You can also request a report at any time.  It will exactly correspond 
to the grid being displayed.  This provides a simple, but unusually 
powerful, custom reporting capability.</p><p>Note the row of buttons 
along the top.  They allow you to bring up other windows which display 
the full tasting note, price file data or other information based upon 
the wine (row in the table) and/or the wine characteristic (column in 
the table) you are focused on at any particular time (here the focus is 
on the bottle size of the 1989 Petrus as indicated by the darker border 
around its cell).  As you move about from row to row or column to column
 in the table the contents of each of these other windows will change 
automatically.   You can click on several of the buttons, if you wish, 
to be taken to other pages that explain the windows they bring up.</p><p>If
 you maintain a visual cellar, you can "Query" your cellar based upon 
any wine characteristic, such as the Parker rating.  Both the bottles in
 your visual cellar and the rows in the corresponding wine table will be
 colorized based upon the characteristic you choose.</p><p>This sample 
shows only a few of the columns which are available.  You can "flip" the
 table so that you see only one wine at a time but can view most, if not
 all, of its characteristics, as shown below.</p><p><br><img src="/2005/img/vertgrid.gif" alt="Detailed Display of a Single Wine" width="382" height="446" align="middle">
