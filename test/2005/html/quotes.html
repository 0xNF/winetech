country where wine is made, bought or sold."  <i>David Shaw, Los Angeles Times</i></p><p>

28.  "A sensualist, passionate lover of wine, and a fierce champion of 
the wine consumer, Parker is largely responsible both for the vastly 
improved quality of wines made throughout the western world, and for the

those who drink wine, especially in the United States."<i>David Shaw, Los Angeles Times</i></p><p>

this book to my best customers. As it is, I shall have to be more 
modest, but give it I will to my best friends." Harry Waugh</p><p>

his approach to Bordeaux than Robert Parker. His book is a boon for 
Bordeaux lovers." Serena Sutcliffe, M.W.</p><p>

Robinson, M.W.,<i> London Sunday Times</i></p><p>

17.  "His influence is unparalled in the history of wine journalism" <i>Decanter Magazine</i></p><p>

 wine critic ... he is genuinely independent, has a legendary tasting 
ability, and usually gets it right ... but that is no reason for him to 
be God." <i>Evening Standard</i></p><p>
