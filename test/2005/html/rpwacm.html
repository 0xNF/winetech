</p></center><p><br><i><b>Robert Parker's Wine Advisor &amp; Cellar Manager</b></i> is the first and only software developed in conjunction with Robert Parker and derived from his newsletter, <b>The Wine Advocate</b>.
 It combines an extensive database of wine information with a unique 
Visual Cellar Manager.  Since its introduction four years ago it has 
become the fastest selling software for the serious wine connoisseur.   <em><b>Here's why...</b></em></p><p><br>
</p><center><img src="/2005/img/problems.gif" alt="The Problems" width="124" height="25"></center><p><br>

Wine lovers tend to become wine collectors.  They want to purchase those
 wines that, with the proper amount of aging, will present a "perfect" 
drinking experience many years hence.  As their cellar grows so do the 
difficulties of managing a wine inventory.  For example, the whole point
 of a cellar is to age each wine until it reaches the point of perfect 
maturity.  Consume it too early and it may not meet expectations -- or 
worse, it may be so tannic as to be undrinkable.  Wait until too late 
and it may have faded into expensive vinegar.</p><p><br>

And then there is the issue of price.  This is a complex area with a 
consumer product that is made by thousands of different producers around
 the world each of whom is affected by the climate during the annual 
growing season in their particular area.</p><p><br>

Finally there is learning more about wines.   One can easily build a 
small library consisting solely of books about wine.  Increasingly, 
however, people are turning to their computers and the Internet as an 
information source.  While there are hundreds of websites relating to 
wine, finding just the right one can be difficult and time consuming.</p><p><br>

Over the past fifteen years the wine critic, Robert M. Parker, has grown
 in stature as the consumer's advocate when it comes to wine selection. 
 His newsletter, <b>The Wine Advocate</b>, is the most widely read publication of its type in the world.  

</p><p><br><i>Newsweek</i> magazine has said of Parker "[he]has 
revolutionized American wine criticism, and...has brought [to it] the 
stringent standards of a fanatic, the high moral purpose of a reformer."
  

</p><p><br>Parker is perhaps best known for being the first wine critic 
to assign a numerical rating to wines.  On his scale each wine gets a 
number from 50-100.  Wine consumers may have seen these ratings posted 
in stores.  Parker also writes a detailed tasting note about thousands 
of wines each year.  This note describes the taste and smell of the 
wine, often talks about the producer and his wine making skills and 
offers advice as to when the wine should be drunk.</p><p><br>



<b>The Wine Price File</b> is, according to Robert Parker,  ".. an 
essential source of current information on the value of fine wine."  
Compiled from over 300 retail and auction catalogs,  it is recognized as
 the definitive source of wine price information.</p><p><br>
