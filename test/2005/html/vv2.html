We hope to add other "virtual tours" of our clients' wine cellars.   To be considered please <a href="mailto:visitmycellar@winetech.com">email us</a> with interesting details about you, your cellar or your use of our software.

</p><p><b>We strive to be honest so we will start with a confession:</b></p><p>
 When we were approached with a proposal to assist the owners of one of 
the country's finest wine cellars in putting it into our software, we 
jumped at the chance.</p><p> It is hard to say whether we were motivated
 more by the prospect of just seeing a cellar of over 25,000 bottles 
(including more than 4,500 larger format bottles) -- virtually all of 
them top rated by Robert Parker --  or by the challenge of seeing if our
 software was up to the task.</p><p> <b>Believe us, it is massive:</b></p><p>This
 cellar was constructed under the owner's home by blasting it out of 
solid rock!  It has grown over the years to accommodate a wine 
collection which knows few equals.</p><p>During the course of teaching 
the owners (who had very limited prior computer experience) we 
encountered a number of problems unique to a collection of this 
magnitude.  Many of them had to do with managing the same wine located 
in multiple areas of the cellar and stored in different bottle sizes.</p><p>
 The result has pleased everyone.   The cellar is now safely stored in a
 300MHz Dell with 128MBs of RAM.  We got invited to a fabulous wine 
tasting! Our clients benefited from enhancements we made and released in
 Version 3.5.  </p><p><b>Curious to see this cellar?</b></p><p><img src="/2005/img/vv2.jpg" alt="Italian Wine Storage" width="386" height="202"></p><p>The owner prefers to remain anonymous. This area stores some of the Italian wines, a particular favorite of the collector.</p><p>And here is a Visual Cellar Area from this part of the cellar (the colors represent Parker ratings):</p><p><img src="/2005/img/itwines.gif" alt="itwines.gif - 13.06 K" width="326" height="374"></p><p>The
 large rack shown here contains 960 bottles.  Note that each bin 
contains two bottles which are shown one over the other - one of the 
options for representing "double deep" bin storage.  </p><p>The Cellar 
Area is named to correspond to the owner's approach to naming physical 
locations within the cellar.  The Live Bin Id is showing that we are 
pointing to bin "25-1" within this rack.  The owner has chosen to 
represent each bin based on its row and column location.  Thus this bin 
is in the 25th column over and the first row down.  </p><p>The full 
cellar contains 42 Cellar Areas identical to this one and 19 other 
Cellar Areas for other types of storage, such as full cases!</p><p>You 
are probably wondering about performance.  How fast can the software be 
when dealing with a cellar of this size?  Well, in the words of the 
cellar's owners, "We find it a challenge to keep up with it!"</p><p></p><center><img src="/2005/img/prior.gif" usemap="#prior" alt="Prior Virtual Cellar Visit" width="76" height="24" border="0">
