</p></center><b> The Visual Cellar Display:</b> This is clearly the most
 striking feature of the software.  Very quick screen display of 
thousands of bottles (up to about 3,000) at one time is technically very
 difficult.  Normal programming techniques - providing the flexibility 
of our software - would be visibly slow even showing as few as 200 
bottles.<p>  A key flexibility feature is the resizability of the Visual
 Cellar windows.  To a degree not often appreciated, the physical 
limitations of a computer monitor impose enormous restrictions on 
computer software.  The ability to expand or contract the cellar windows
 greatly increases the usability of the system.</p><p>  Another key 
feature is the integration of the underlying SQL database with the 
Visual Cellar.  The automatic coloring of bottles to present the results
 of a database query is a particularly exciting feature of the software.
  To our knowledge, no other computer application utilizes visual 
presentation of database information to the degree achieved in this 
feature.  </p><p>  A third key feature is the integration of the table 
presentation of wines with the Visual Cellar.  The "focus" in the Visual
 Cellar automatically tracks with the "focus" within any of the rows in 
the table creating a clear visual link between these two alternate 
displays of information.</p><p><b>Mixed Database of Shipped and User Information:</b>
  Many products present predefined databases of computerized 
information.  A few even focus on wine related information.  Many other 
products are designed for user created databases.  Contact Managers are a
 common example.  Very few products deal with a mixture of the two 
scenarios.  Creating a smooth integration of the two is technically 
demanding.   The degree to which this has been achieved is best 
illustrated by the capability of the software to automatically link 
wines <i><b>added by the user</b></i> with <i><b>future </b></i>reviews of the same wine written by Robert Parker!</p><p><b>Intelligent Lookup: </b>
 The Internet has created a wide understanding of the concept of 
text-based information location.  Popular Internet facilities like Yahoo
 and Alta Vista quickly become necessities to frequent browsers of the 
Web.  Anyone experienced in their use knows that careful wording of the 
search text is essential.  It is also typically unforgiving and can 
therefore be frustrating.  This software attempts to create a more 
forgiving environment.  It automatically creates word-by-word indexes 
for seven key wine characteristics (producer, label name, country, 
region, location, vintage, and variety).  The magic comes in being able 
to input "snippets" of text to indicate the desired wines.  You need not
 know the correct spelling of <b>Tetre-Roteboeuf</b> to find it 
virtually instantly.  Nor do you have to identify 1990 as a vintage.  
The result is the ability to precisely find wines through a text string 
that comes naturally.</p><p>  You can even bring up a list of all the 
key word entries beginning with any letter combination, optionally even 
with a display of frequency.  The same capability exists for the words 
used in the tasting notes (Just how often <i><b>does </b></i>Parker use the word <b>bold</b>?).  </p><p>For
 the even more adventurous, we provide a facility that will compile all 
the unique entries for any wine characteristic, again with optional 
display of frequency.  This list itself can be quite educational.  Once 
the list is up,  just click on any entry to see a list of all matching 
wines!  The list stays up for re-clicking.  A very powerful way to 
explore the world of wines.</p><p><b>A Few More "Quickies":</b>

</p><ul type="disc">
<li>Drag and drop bottles from one location in a cellar to another 
location in that cellar or in another cellar window.  All bottles with 
the same characteristic can be moved at the same time.
</li><li>Bin order and bin labeling can be done virtually anyway you 
want.  Neither need be just "left to right" or "top to bottom".  Common 
label sequences are generated automatically.
</li><li>Dynamic display of the bin label under the cursor.
</li><li>Easy experimentation with new bottle arrangements.  Move all 
bottles with a common characteristic in bulk to see, for example, if 
your Italian wines will all fit in a particular cellar area.  Like a 
spreadsheet, if you don't save a rearrangement, the current data is 
unchanged.  Most databases don't provide this type of flexible analysis.
