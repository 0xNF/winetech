We hope to add other "virtual tours" of our clients' wine cellars.   To be considered please <a href="mailto:visitmycellar@winetech.com">email us</a> with interesting details about you, your cellar or your use of our software.</p><p>

<b>Here's how we got things started:</b></p><p>When we approached a few 
clients about this project, Steve Ashkenazy responded that he was 
building a new cellar himself.  We thought it would be fun to follow the
 construction project right through to seeing his new cellar on the 
screen of his PC - a trusty  Compaq 200MHz Pentium MMX with 48MB of RAM.</p><p><img src="/2005/img/savv1.jpg" alt="Steve's Cellar Under Construction" height="246"></p><p><b>Steve kept us updated on the construction by email:</b></p><p>"Well...lets
 see ... I still have half the ceiling to put up ... then spackle and 
paint.  The redwood racks are being made at Kedco. I don't get all that 
much time to work on it, so I'd say about 4 weeks until its done, 
without racks.</p><p> It is a 5'X5' room or so and should hold about 
1000 bottles. Double deep racks on the left of the door and single deep 
on the right."</p><p>

<b>We also got to know a bit about Steve:</b></p><p> "I am 38 and import
 and sell stringed instruments, violins, viola's, cello's etc. from 
Europe and sell them to music stores all over the country.</p><p> I got 
interested in wine along with my interest in good food. I think wine is 
important for a healthy way of life. As my taste for good food grew, so 
did my wine interest. I now have about 300 plus bottles. All but a few 
are top wines. I like all types of wine, but red over white.  I love so 
many I don't know where to start...Spanish wines are wonderful...but my 
favorite would have to be great French Burgundy.</p><p> I get only two magazines, <i>The Wine Advocate</i> and <i>Wine Spectator</i>.  However, when I find the time, I also read <i>Food and Wine </i>and <i>Gourmet</i>."</p><p> 

<b>He has some kind things to say about our software:</b></p><p>"When I 
first got the Parker program I only had about 50 bottles, so putting 
them in didn't take long. As my cellar grew I put bottles in as I got 
them. I also keep a card file on all my wines.</p><p> There are so many 
features on this program I don't know where to begin. So many things I 
still need to learn, but I will say that it is so easy to work 
everything, once you have used it a little.  I can find wines in seconds
 and, if one isn't in the database, I can just put it in.   Also, I love
 how you can change who's tasting you can see first, Parker's or mine!"</p><p>

<b>By now you must be curious to see the result:</b></p><p><img src="/2005/img/savv9.jpg" alt="Steve Shows Off His New Cellar" width="173" hspace="6" height="236" align="left">Here's a photo of Steve showing off his new cellar.  </p><p>We
 don't know about you, but we would say that he has a promising career 
in wine cellar construction ahead of him if he ever gets tired of the 
music instrument business!</p><p></p><p>Below is an actual screen shot 
from our software which shows the tall rack to Steve's immediate right 
in the photo.  This rack occupies the space to the right of the cooling 
unit (see the "under construction" photo above) and is on the "double 
deep racks" side of the cellar.  <img src="/2005/img/sacellar.gif" alt="Part of Steve's Visual Cellar" width="160" vspace="6" hspace="6" height="313" align="right"></p><p>Steve has chosen to represent each layer in a separate Cellar Area (window).   The bottles shown here are in the front.  </p><p>Steve
 has used the capability to name each rack and Cellar Area -- here the 
Cellar Area is called "Section C" while the particular rack is called 
"Section C1".  The back layer rack is named "Section C2" to help Steve 
remember what each rack contains.</p><p>This screen shot illustrates the Live Bottle ID which shows that the wine being pointed to is a 1992 Taylor Vintage Port.
