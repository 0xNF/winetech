 M. Parker, Jr. was born in Baltimore, Maryland, on July 23, 1947. An 
honors graduate of the University of Maryland, with a major in History, 
and a minor in Art History, he attended the University of Maryland Law 
School, graduating in 1973. For ten and one half years he was an 
Attorney, a Senior Attorney, and later an Assistant General Counsel for 
the Farm  Credit Banks of Baltimore. On March 9, 1984 he resigned his 
position as Assistant General Counsel to devote full attention to wine 
writing.<p><br>

His interest in wine began in 1967, when he spent a month abroad during 
his Christmas vacation, visiting a girlfriend (who is now his wife of 30
 years) at the University of Strasbourg in Alsace, France.</p><p><br>

By 1975, he began to think about writing about wine and commencing his 
own "independent, consumer's guide," largely because of the paucity of 
reliable information on wine quality. Friends and family advised that 
his career in law should be given top priority, and that wine writing 
was a romantic, unprofitable profession.</p><p><br>

</map>Nevertheless, by 1978, the concept of a wine publication was formulated. The first issue of <i>The Wine Advocate</i>,
 a complimentary issue, was sent out to mailing lists purchased from 
several major wine retailers. The initial number of charter subscribers 
in August, 1978, was less than 600.</p><p><br>

Twenty years later, <i>The Wine Advocate </i>has over 40,000 
subscribers, in every state in the United States, and in over 37 foreign
 countries. Today, virtually every knowledgeable observer agree that <i>The Wine Advocate</i>
 exerts the most significant influence on the serious wine consumer's 
buying habits and trends not only in America, but in France, England, 
Switzerland, Japan, Taiwan, Singapore, Russia, Mexico, Brazil, and 
China.  Additionally, <i>The Wine Advocate</i> is translated into the French language.

In addition to doing the writing and tasting for <i>The Wine Advocate</i>, which is published bi-monthly in Parkton, Maryland, Mr. Parker has been a contributing editor for <i>Food and Wine Magazine</i>. He has also writen periodically for the English magazine, <i>The Field</i> and has been the wine critic for France's <i>L'Express</i> magazine, the first time a non-Frenchman has held this position. </p><p><br>

In November, 1985 his first book <i>Bordeaux </i>was published by Simon and Schuster. <i>Bordeaux </i>went
 into six printings, was a selection of the Book of the Month Club, and 
received international critical acclaim. An English edition of <i>Bordeaux</i>
 was published by the London firm of Dorling, Kindersely, Ltd. It won 
the prestigious Glenfiddich Award as England's top wine book of 1986. 
The Paris-based firm of Solar published <i>Bordeaux</i> in France in 
1989, where the book promptly was reprinted three times. Moreover, 
France's Book of the Month Club, the largest in the world, made <i>Bordeaux</i> its "selection of the month" in January, 1991. Foreign language editions of  <i>Bordeaux</i> have been published in Japan, Germany, and Sweden. </p><p>

In 1987, Simon and Schuster published two more wine books by Mr. Parker, <i>Parker's Wine Buyer's Guide</i> and <i>The Wines of the Rh'ne Valley and Provence</i>.
 The latter book won the Tastemaker's Award in 1989 as the top wine book
 of the year published in America and The Wine Guild's Wine Book of the 
Year Award in The United Kingdom.</p><p><br>

In April, 1989, his second <i>Wine Buyer's Guide</i> was published, and his fifth book, <i>Burgundy</i>, was published in 1990. <i>Burgundy</i> was also published in both France and England in 1991. In the fall of 1991, a revised and greatly expanded edition of <i>Bordeaux </i>was
 published. It has appeared in Japanese, German, and French editions. In
 1992, it was the winner of the IACP Award (International Association of
 Cooking Professionals) as the top wine book of the year. Also in 1992, 
Maryland's Loyola College recognized Mr. Parker as the "Marylander of 
the Year." </p><p><br>

In 1993, the third edition of <i>Parker's Wine Buyer's Guide</i> was published. The German language edition of <i>Bordeaux</i>
 won that country's top prize for books on wine and gastronomy, the 
"Goldene Feder." In France, the 1994 French language edition of <i>Bordeaux</i> spent three months on France's "Best Seller" list.  In 1997/1998 <i>Le Guide Parker</i> (the French language edition of his buyer's guide) spent 27 weeks on France's top ten list of books. </p><p><br>

Buyer's Guide, a book that received huge commericial and critical 
success.  It was republished in England and France, where it is called <i>The Guide Parker</i>.  In 1997, his ninth book, <i>The Wines of the Rhone Valley</i>, was publised in both English and French.  In 1998, his tenth book, the 3rd edition of <i>Bordeaux</i>,

On March 29, 1999, President Jacques Chirac signed a decree authorizing Robert M. Parker, Jr. to be a <i>Chevalier dans l'Ordre de la Legion d'Honneur</i>.
   He was decorated directly by President Jacques Chirac at a ceremony 
at the Elysee Palace on June 22, 1999.  President Chirac, in bestowing 
France's highest honor, stated that "Robert Parker is the most followed 
and influential critic of French wines in the world, something I 
(President Chirac) witnessed recently when choosing wine for President 
Clinton, who automatically referred to Robert Parker as his reference 
for making a proper wine buying decision."  In 1993, the late President 
Francois Mitterand made Robert Parker a <i>Chevalier dans l'Ordre National du Merite</i>.
   The Legion of Honor was created by Napoleon Bonaparte in 1802 to 
honor the highest level of achievement to France.  Robert Parker is one 
of only a handful of foreigners to have received France's two highest 
Presidential honors.</p><p><br>

Robert M. Parker, Jr, who, in February, 1999, was profiled in a two-part front page article in the <i>Los Angeles Times</i>
 by their Pulitzer Prize winning media critic, David Shaw, has written 
eleven books on wine that have been best sellers not only in the United 
States, but also in their translated versions in France, Japan, Germany,
 Sweden and Russia.  He is also author of the independent consumer's 
guide to fine wine, <i>The Wine Advocate</i>, which he has written and published for over two decades.  In the<i> Los Angeles Times</i>,
 David Shaw called Parker "a fierce champion of the wine consumer," "the
 most powerful critic of any kind, any where," "and "a sensualist, 
passionate lover of wine, who is largely responsible for the vastly 
improved quality of wines made throughout the western world and for the 
exponential growth in interest, knowledge and sophistication of those 
who drink wine."</p><p><br>

Robert Parker lives in the countryside of northern Maryland with his 
wife of 30 years, Patricia, his daughter, Maia, and various basset 
hounds and English bulldogs.
